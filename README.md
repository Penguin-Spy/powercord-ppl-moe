# Powercord ppl.moe

This is a powercord plugin that displays a user's ppl.moe profile as a new tab in the user's modal

# Planned features

- [x] Get it working at all
- [ ] Don't commit copyright infringement
- [ ] i18n (translations & also emojis in field titles like in the real site)
- [ ] Hide tab if the user doesn't have a ppl.moe profile
- [ ] Display the user's pronouns next to their name in messages (like the pronoundb plugin)
- [ ] Display the user's badges (Admin, Beta tester, bug reporter [any others?])
- [ ] Full markdown formatting (tables, using underscores, strikethrough, seperators, code & codeblocks, and more!)
- [ ] Icons for themes?
- [ ] Change layout of modal a bit (move connections to their own tab, put notes outside of a tab, have our tab be 1st)?
- [ ] Display the user's latest post? idk but if people want it i'll add it
