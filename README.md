# Powercord ppl.moe
![Clone count badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatthegit.penguinspy.repl.co%2Fsheilds%2Fpowercord-ppl-moe)

This is a powercord plugin that displays a user's ppl.moe profile as a new tab in the user's modal  
It also shows their pronouns next to their name in messages (similar to & compatible with the PronounDB plugin).
This plugin is not endorsed or in any way affiliated with ppl.moe or amy!  
I just thought it was a neat idea & the discord.bio plugin has been broken for quite a while

# Planned features

- [x] Get it working at all
- [x] Don't use hard-coded classes that will break when Discord changes stuff
- [x] Icon for the tab instead of text when using the Comfy theme
- [x] Don't commit copyright infringement
- [x] i18n (able to load them, only english strings exist currently)
- [x] Display the user's pronouns next to their name in messages (like the pronoundb plugin)
- [x] Hide tab if the user doesn't have a ppl.moe profile
- [x] Add a "connection" for the ppl.moe profile so there's a link to the website
- [x] Move the creation of the profile tab to .jsx files (no this isn't feature creep stop looking at the commits to this file >:(  
This will be the 1.0 release point!
- [ ] Display the user's tagline
- [ ] Display the user's badges (Admin, Beta tester, bug reporter [any others?])
- [ ] Full markdown formatting (tables, using underscores, strikethrough, seperators, code & codeblocks, and more!)
- [ ] Change layout of modal a bit (move connections to their own tab, put notes outside of a tab, have our tab be 1st)?
- [ ] Display the user's latest post? idk but if people want it i'll add it
