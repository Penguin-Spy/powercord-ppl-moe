![clones](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatthegit.penguinspy.repl.co%2Fsheilds%2Fpowercord-ppl-moe) [![Powercord](https://img.shields.io/badge/client-Powercord-7289D9?logo=discord&logoColor=fff)](https://powercord.dev/)  
This is a powercord plugin that displays a user's ppl.moe profile as a new tab in the user's modal.  
It also shows their pronouns next to their name in messages (similar to & compatible with the PronounDB plugin).  

# Features
- A new tab in the user modal that displays their ppl.moe profile
- ~~Does not show the tab for users that do not have a ppl.moe profile~~ (broken currently)
- Tab icons (instead of text) for the Comfy theme!
- A new connection that links to their profile on the [ppl.moe website](https://ppl.moe/)
- Displays a user's pronouns in the message header, just like the [PronounDB plugin](https://github.com/cyyynthia/pronoundb-powercord)
- Automatically hides PronounDB's pronouns if there are ppl.moe ones to show
- Settings for the above two features

# Installation
Open command prompt and run:  
```cd powercord/src/Powercord/plugins && git clone https://github.com/Penguin-Spy/powercord-ppl-moe```  
Only Powercord is supported at this time. I may write a version for [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord "A Discord mod for Android") at some point.
