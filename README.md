This is a powercord plugin that displays a user's [ppl.moe](https://ppl.moe/) profile as a new tab in the user's modal.  
It also shows their pronouns next to their name in messages (similar to & compatible with the [PronounDB](https://pronoundb.org/) plugin).  
 
# Features
- A new tab in the user modal that displays a user's ppl.moe profile (if they have one)
- A new connection that links to the profile on the ppl.moe website
- Displays a user's pronouns in the message header, just like the [PronounDB plugin](https://github.com/cyyynthia/pronoundb-powercord)
- Automatically hides PronounDB's pronouns if there are ppl.moe ones to show (optional)
- Shows a cute little badge next to a user's name in chat messages if they have a profile
- Optional tab icon (instead of text) for theme consistency

# Known Issues
- On client open/reload, the very first user modal opened will not display the tab. However, this fixes itself as soon as you close & reopen any user modal.

# Installation
## Replugged/Powercord
> If you are migrating from Powercord and already have the plugin installed, you don't need to reinstall.  

Open this link to install the plugin: https://replugged.dev/install?url=Penguin-Spy/powercord-ppl-moe

## Topaz
Open the Topaz settings and copy+paste `Penguin-Spy/powercord-ppl-moe` into the "Add Plugin" box, and then press enter.

## Other client mods
I may write a version for [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord "A Discord mod for Android") at some point.  
This plugin will never support BetterDiscord/BandagedDiscord or whatever people are calling it this week. (it's the Minecraft Forge of Discord mods)
