This is a powercord plugin that displays a user's ppl.moe profile as a new tab in the user's modal.  
It also shows their pronouns next to their name in messages (similar to & compatible with the PronounDB plugin).  

# Features
- A new tab in the user modal that displays their ppl.moe profile
- Does not show the tab for users that do not have a ppl.moe profile
- Tab icons (instead of text) for the Comfy theme!
- A new connection that links to their profile on the [ppl.moe website](https://ppl.moe/)
- Displays a user's pronouns in the message header, just like the [PronounDB plugin](https://github.com/cyyynthia/pronoundb-powercord)
- Automatically hides PronounDB's pronouns if there are ppl.moe ones to show
- Settings for the above two features

# Planned features
- [ ] Display the user's tagline
- [ ] Display the user's badges (Admin, Beta tester, bug reporter [any others?])
- [ ] Full markdown formatting (tables, using underscores, strikethrough, seperators, code & codeblocks, and more!)
- [ ] Change layout of modal a bit (move connections to their own tab, put notes outside of a tab, have our tab be 1st, obviously settings for this)?
- [ ] Display the user's latest post? idk but if people want it i'll add it
